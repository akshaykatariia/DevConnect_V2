<h1 align="center">💻 DevConnect – Developer Matchmaking Platform</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>Find, match, and collaborate with developers who share your skills and interests.</b><br/>
  Built using <b>React.js</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express.js</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, and <b>Tailwind CSS</b>.

## 💡 Why It Was Created

The motivation behind **DevConnect** came from a common issue faced by developers —  
> *“I want to collaborate or work on side projects, but I don’t know where to find like-minded developers.”*

Traditional networking platforms (like LinkedIn) are too formal, while social platforms lack skill-based filtering.  
**DevConnect** bridges that gap by offering a **casual, swipe-based platform** to meet developers based on their **tech stack, goals, and interests** — just like Tinder, but for coding buddies.
